Per user crontab-like configuration file, e.g.:

# time between checks to see if device is around
poll_time=60

# device-address * * * * * action

or maybe use crontab with checking with the daemon to see if the device is alive
and just give the daemon addresses to monitor

devices=addr1,addr2,addr3


send event on connect/disconnect (for implementing screen lock for example)



use socket? dbus? none (is_connected doesn't need privileges)
pandwatchdog --is-connected ADDR && backup_my_device

pandwatchdog --daemon --poll ADDR --poll-time 60



pand --devup /etc/pandwatchdog/connect --devdown /etc/pandwatchdog/disconnect
